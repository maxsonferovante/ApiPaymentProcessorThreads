feat: Add GraalVM native reflection configuration

This commit introduces a new configuration class `NativeConfig` to explicitly register classes for reflection when building a native image with GraalVM. This is crucial for Spring Data MongoDB to correctly persist and retrieve data, as it heavily relies on reflection.

The following classes are registered:
- `PaymentDocument`: The main MongoDB document entity.
- `PaymentProcessorType`: An enum used within `PaymentDocument`.
- `PaymentRequest`: DTO for incoming payment requests.
- `Payment`: Internal domain model for payments.
- `PaymentsProcess`: Model for managing payment processing flow.

This change addresses the issue where payments were not being saved to MongoDB when running the application as a native image inside a Docker container, due to missing reflection metadata.
